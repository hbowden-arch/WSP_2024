When a massive star has burned until its center (core) is all Iron, it has run out of fuel to burn. With energy no longer radiating out from the center, gravity finally wins the battle and the star starts to collapse in on itself. As we learned before, there are two possible ends for massive stars. Neutron stars and black holes. These are the remnants left behind by what used to be massive stars, but before our massive stars can become these one more thing must happen.\n",
